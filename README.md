## About

This is a challenge designed by [Arewa Data Science Academy](https://arewadatascience.github.io) to help improve Python skills through daily exercises inspired by the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. 

Each day presents task that will help in building better habits, and become more proficient in Python, so as to gain a deeper understanding of the language and be able to apply acquired knowledge to real-world problems.

Knowing fully well that **consistency is key**, each task needs to be completed every day to get the most out of the challenge.
